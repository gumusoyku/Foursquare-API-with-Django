## (1) Post has been replaced with get                   ##
## (2) In the form, 'query' parameter replaced with      ##
## 'objct', so the check needed to determine where       ##
## the search come from became no longer necessary       ##
## and therefore, only one check is enough               ##
## (3) some of the names replaced with better ones       ##
## (4) import section redesign                           ##
## (5) settings.py now has the information about id and  ##
## secret and version and views.py pulls the data        ##
## (6) additional check has been writed                  ##
## (7) tried to make the code more modular               ##
